# DOWNLOAD FILE GROUPER

**TODO:**  
- Implement the caching of the download folder directory in order to use it as a background script everytime the script is launched.  
~~- Make the process a background script once the user has answered all the prompts.~~

**Additional features:**  
- Implement choice of which file extension you want to group.  
- Add a log text file of all the file that were moved to which folder.
